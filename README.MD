# Cuck Bot

**Cuck Bot** is a simple Discord bot built with **TypeScript** and **discord.js**. It is designed to greet new members joining your server and respond to specific messages based on pre-set logic. The bot also allows for customization of the greeting message channel and the messages it sends.

## Features
- **Welcome New Users**: When a new user joins the server, Cuck Bot sends a greeting message to a specified channel.
- **Customizable Greeting Channel**: The channel for greeting new users can be set via the botâ€™s configuration.
- **Message Handling**: Cuck Bot can be extended to handle different types of user interactions, such as responding to specific messages or commands.

## How it Works
- The bot listens to the `guildMemberAdd` event to detect when a new member joins.
- Once a new member joins, the bot sends a greeting message to the pre-configured greeting channel.
- The bot can be further expanded to handle different types of user interactions, such as responding to specific messages or commands.
